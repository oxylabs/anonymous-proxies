## Level 1: Elite proxies

[Elite proxy servers](https://https//oxylabs.io/products/elite-proxies) offer the most privacy. In addition to hiding the IP address, they’ll also conceal the fact that the user is employing a proxy. Elite proxies omit identifying headers when sending requests to the destination server. To keep the user entirely anonymous, the following headers might be removed:

```
Identifying HTTP headers example:

Authorization
From
Proxy-Authorization
Proxy-Connection
Via
X-Forwarded-For

```


## Level 2: Anonymous proxies 

Anonymous proxies provide mid-level anonymity. They still conceal the IP address, but the destination server will know that the connection goes through a proxy. Unlike with elite proxies, some headers – such as the Via header – are passed along to the server.


## Level 3: Transparent proxies

These proxies provide no anonymity to the client. They include the user’s IP address in the X-Forwarded-For, and keep the proxy IP visible in the Via header. These proxies are usually configured on the server side to control website traffic, and the user is rarely aware that their connection is directed through a proxy.


## Anonymous proxies for personal use


In terms of individual uses, an anonymous proxy can enhance the browsing experience. If you want to avoid targeted ads, bypass geo-restrictions, or protect your search history, anonymous proxies are the way to go. Additionally, it can be a good preventative measure that protects against identity theft.

## Free proxy servers: risks

**Encryption breaches** - 
Free proxies rarely support HTTP(S) connections, and without it, your online activities can be monitored. 

**Private data leaks** - 
Untrustworthy proxy providers can access user’s cookies, meaning private data may be at risk.

**Malicious software** - 

The majority of publicly accessible proxies are unreliable or, even worse, contain malicious software.
